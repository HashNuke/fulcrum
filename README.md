Fulcrum (Bushido fork)
======================

Fulcrum is an application to provide a user story based backlog management
system for agile development teams.

This fork of Fulcrum adds support to work on Bushido. It does work normally when hosted on platforms other than Bushido.

Goals
-----

Fulcrum is a clone of [Pivotal Tracker](http://pivotaltracker.com/).  It will
almost certainly never surpass the functionality, usability and sheer
awesomeness of Pivotal Tracker, but aims to provide a usable alternative for
users who require a Free and Open Source solution.

Roadmap
-------

Please note, any resemblance of the roadmap to the actual development timeline
is purely coincidental.

* Stories, Bugs and Chores
